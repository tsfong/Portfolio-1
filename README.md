For the basic skeleton, editing, layouts, animation, and game logic, I'm looking at an estimated 10 hours. However, I'm sure with the debugging and fluctuations in willpower, we'll see the final total hours that it takes for this project. 

#### MVP

- Playable Oracle card game 
- Pull data from an api I'll find
- Make sure page loads
- Make sure interactive content works
- Ensure links are correctly added

#### PostMVP 

- Readability is A1
- Incorporate some kind of UI/UX design
- No spelling mistakes
- Continue to beautify the pages

## Functional Components (Oracle Cards)

Being ambitious and including a fully-functional Oracle card game so that it's a fun bonus accessory to my website. I think it'l show my extra flair, also I really like games. Oracle cards are for self-reflection and it's completely up to the person to interpret it how they'd like. I think the staying on the theme of self-reflection and playfulness is a great thing to incorporate into my portfolio. It adds a bit of "me" flair.
